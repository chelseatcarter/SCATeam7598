The SCA Constellations is an all-girls FIRST Robotics team from Saint Catherine of Siena Academy in Wixom, Michigan. As a part of FIRST Robotics Competition, we believe in cultivating gracious professionalism among other aspects of FIRST.

WHAT IS FIRST?
FIRST Robotics Competition is a high school robotics league in which the students on their teams are given a challenge at the beginning of their season and have 6 weeks to build a robot that completes the challenge. Students learn life skills like gracious professionalism and teamwork, and job skills such as marketing, outreach, safety, and even photography. The professional part of the atmosphere prepares students not only for the workplace but for proper professional etiquette.

FIRST 2020 is Infinite Recharge.
